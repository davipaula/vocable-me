00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:15.411
The movie "Straight Outta Compton"
comes out. I'm so excited.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.229
I'm from LA, so this movie
is particularly close to my heart.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.970
I saw it in theaters three times.

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:25.965
So I'm cruising the Internet devouring
everything I can about this movie.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:27.875
I come across the casting call.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.285
This movie has already come out
and I'm no actress,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:32.345
so I wouldn't actually audition,

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.042
but I just wondered, hypothetically,

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.962
if I did, what role would I get?

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.102
I look at the casting call,
I'm going down the categories,

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:43.272
and I start at the top: the A girls.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.349
The casting call reads:

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
"These are the hottest
of the hottest, models,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.749
must have real hair, no extensions."

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.909
Well, since I have 20 inches
of Brazilian hair extensions on my head,

00:00:57.508 --> 00:00:59.118
doesn't quite apply to me.

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:00.154
But that's fine.

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:03.214
I go to the next category: the B girls.

00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:08.891
The casting call reads:
"These are fine girls, long natural hair,

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.411
must have light skin,
Beyoncé's the prototype hit here."

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:14.882
Light skin?

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:17.389
Also not me.

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.052
And might I add: not even Beyoncé
made the cut to be an A girl.

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.741
But that's fine.

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.321
(Laughter)

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.801
I go to the next category: the C girls.

00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:28.892
The casting call reads:

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.967
"These are African American girls,

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:34.777
can have extensions,
must be medium to light skin toned."

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:39.140
Now, maybe back when I lived in Boston,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.700
in the middle of the winter

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.764
can I get away with being
"medium skin toned,"

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:46.475
but since I've come back
to sunny California

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.125
where I spend all my free time
baking in the sun,

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:50.335
not so much.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.520
So I scroll all the way down

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:54.677
to the last category:

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:56.786
the D girls.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.400
The casting call reads:
"These are African American girls,

00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:04.133
poor, not in good shape,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.479
must have a darker skin tone."

00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:09.015
A darker skin tone.

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:12.702
Well, I guess that's me:

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:15.168
a D girl.

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:19.035
When I first read this, I felt betrayed.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.600
Any given year,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.940
there are just a handful of movies
starring black actors and actresses,

00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:26.151
just a handful of opportunities

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.862
when people can see actresses
that look like me, on the big screen,

00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:32.604
and see that we are fierce
and beautiful and desirable.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.170
So I felt betrayed.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.580
Not even in these small circles
I'm allowed to feel beautiful?

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:42.154
I felt shoved aside for those
of more "favorable" features:

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:47.146
light skin, light eyes,
long, soft real hair.

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:50.205
But the more I thought about it,

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:52.402
the more the feeling
of betrayal slipped away

00:02:52.554 --> 00:02:56.754
for the more familiar feeling
of "that's just the way it is"

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:01.435
because in my world,
this phenomenon is all too familiar.

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:05.771
Something just as sinister
and subtle as racism:

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.780
Colorism, the discrimination of those
with a darker skin tone,

00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:14.004
typically among individuals
within the same racial or ethnic group.

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:17.433
The story of colorism in the US
begins with slavery.

00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:21.685
The mass rape of African slave females
by white male slave masters

00:03:22.032 --> 00:03:25.112
gave birth to a cohort
of mixed-race slave children.

00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:28.218
These mixed-race slaves are related
to the slave masters

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:31.588
and had more Anglo features,
and were given preferential treatment

00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:34.688
and allowed to work inside the house,
doing less strenuous work,

00:03:34.688 --> 00:03:36.688
as opposed to the darker skinned slaves

00:03:36.688 --> 00:03:39.688
that had to work out in the fields,
doing more laborious work.

00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:42.177
Even after slavery was abolished,

00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:44.748
whites still gave more
preferential treatment

00:03:44.748 --> 00:03:47.208
to blacks that had
more Anglo-type features,

00:03:47.404 --> 00:03:50.934
giving them better access to jobs,
housing and education.

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:54.926
The thing is, though,
even within the black community,

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:57.783
black people used skin tone
and facial features

00:03:57.783 --> 00:03:59.883
to discriminate against each other.

00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.241
They would only allow
entrance into sororities,

00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:05.171
fraternities or elite social clubs

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.691
to blacks that were able to display
Anglo-type features.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.125
They'd go through a series of tests
to see if you fit the bill.

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:14.288
One well-known test was

00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.621
the "brown paper bag" test.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.378
Where if you were lighter
than a brown paper bag,

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:20.665
you're in!

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:24.311
But if you were darker
than a brown paper bag,

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:25.965
you're out.

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:29.226
Another well-known test
was the pencil test,

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:32.320
where they would take a pencil
and run it through your hair

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:36.755
to make sure that it's straight enough
so the pencil wouldn't get stuck.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.010
The last test was called the shadow test,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.360
where they would take a flashlight
and shine it against your profile

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.780
and look at the shadow that your profile
made against the wall.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.548
And if it matched that
of a white person's profile,

00:04:49.548 --> 00:04:51.258
you're fine.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:54.108
But if it didn't, you're out.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.919
Now, though these practices
are no longer in effect today,

00:04:57.926 --> 00:05:00.586
the effects of them
are still very much so present.

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:02.702
I remember a common "compliment"

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.822
I would often get
in middle and high school,

00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:07.862
often told to me by other black males;
it went to the effect of:

00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:11.022
"Oh! You're so pretty
for a dark skinned girl."

00:05:11.483 --> 00:05:12.483
And it doesn't help

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:15.543
that the media continues
to place a premium on lighter skin

00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:20.452
by retouching and photoshopping
the skin of actresses of color

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:22.752
before putting them
on the cover of magazines,

00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:24.531
as can be seen here,

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.206
here,

00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:29.595
here

00:05:30.675 --> 00:05:31.835
and even here.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.370
Now, colorism is not
just isolated to the US,

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:39.505
its effects are global,

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:43.065
as best illustrated by the skin-lightening
and skin-bleaching creams

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:44.655
all over the world.

00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:46.585
In India and Asia alone,

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.679
skin lightening and skin bleaching
is a multi-billion dollar business.

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:54.414
Despite the harmful toxins
that are present in these products,

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:57.779
people are still willing
to take the risk and use them

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.009
in order to achieve what they
are led to believe is beautiful.

00:06:01.854 --> 00:06:04.574
And beauty products
have flocked on this insight.

00:06:04.926 --> 00:06:07.896
One known brand, "Vaseline,"
even partnered with Facebook

00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:11.586
to come up with an app that would
lighten the skin of you profile picture

00:06:11.832 --> 00:06:14.172
in order to promote
their skin-lightening cream.

00:06:14.914 --> 00:06:17.764
And you can't travel throughout Asia
without being inundated

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:20.114
by advertising and commercials

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:24.482
that promise happiness and success
if you could just be a little bit lighter.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.224
(Laughter)

00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:35.861
Studies have shown that these messages
that we see at a young age

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:38.111
have a profound effect on us.

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:41.089
In 2010, CNN did a study

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:44.989
where they interviewed young children,
just five, six, seven years old,

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:47.839
and asked them to place
values and attributes to people

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.529
based on their skin tone.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.369
Here's a clip from that study.

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:53.524
(Video starts)

00:06:53.524 --> 00:06:55.614
Interviewer: And why is she
the smart child?

00:06:55.614 --> 00:07:00.114
Girl: Because she is white.

00:07:00.114 --> 00:07:02.834
Interviewer: OK. Show me the dumb child.

00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:07.377
And why is she the dumb child?

00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:09.001
Girl: Because she's black.

00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:12.807
Interviewer: Well, show me the ugly child.

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:15.315
And why is she the ugly child?

00:07:15.315 --> 00:07:16.878
Girl: Because she's black.

00:07:17.191 --> 00:07:19.281
Interviewer: Show me
the good-looking child.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.860
And why is she the good-looking child?

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.675
Girl: Because she's light-skinned.

00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:29.945
Chika Okoro: These messages
that we see at such a young age

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:31.995
and these messages that we internalize,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.120
they stay with us.

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.969
They stayed with me.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.660
And though I denied it and blocked it out
and I say I'm strong, I'm smart,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.190
I'm accomplished, I'm beautiful,
I'm here at Stanford and I'm not a D girl,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.160
this stuff, these messages,

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.547
they stayed with me.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.079
And they manifest in this voice
that makes me question,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:56.399
makes me doubt
and makes me think: "But wait ..."

00:07:57.219 --> 00:07:58.569
"Am I a D girl?"

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.840
It stays with me.

00:08:01.709 --> 00:08:04.389
And so now, whenever someone
gives me compliment or says,

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.179
"Oh! You look nice, you look pretty,"

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:09.149
the voice fills in the rest
of the sentence with:

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:11.049
"for a dark skinned girl."

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:13.064
It stays with me.

00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:16.248
And it makes me question my intentions

00:08:16.248 --> 00:08:17.448
because even though I say

00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:20.398
that I have these extensions
just for fun and that I like them,

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:21.748
that voice says "No!"

00:08:22.164 --> 00:08:25.244
"You got them because you're trying
to reach a beauty standard

00:08:25.244 --> 00:08:27.464
you can actually never obtain."

00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:30.215
It stays with me.

00:08:31.164 --> 00:08:34.014
Even as I go to send
a simple text message,

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.084
that voice in my head tells me

00:08:36.084 --> 00:08:39.594
that I should be embarrassed
or ashamed when I scroll

00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:45.258
all the way to the end,
to the last, darkest emoji.

00:08:46.732 --> 00:08:47.912
It stays with me.

00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:51.411
But I don't want it to stay with me.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.240
And the good thing is it doesn't have to.

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:58.729
Because these beauty
preferences that we have,

00:08:58.729 --> 00:09:00.619
they're not something we are born with,

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:01.809
they're learned.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:05.348
And if they're learned,
they can be unlearned.

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:09.277
Among us are CEOs and co-founders,
directors of marketing,

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:12.435
you all are the arbiters
of what society considers beautiful

00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:14.925
by deciding who you chose
to put in your advertising

00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:17.385
or who you chose to be
the face of you brand.

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.581
So you have the opportunity
to make the unconventional choice.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.260
And those of us that consume
these messages, we play our role too.

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:28.769
Because the first step
to change is awareness.

00:09:29.337 --> 00:09:32.257
And now everyone in this room
is a little more aware

00:09:32.719 --> 00:09:35.309
and will see the world
just a little bit differently.

00:09:35.793 --> 00:09:37.623
And you don't have to passively accept

00:09:37.623 --> 00:09:40.053
what society tells us
to think is beautiful.

00:09:40.292 --> 00:09:43.802
We can question it,
and we can challenge the status quo.

00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:45.702
Because when we do,

00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:49.966
we get one step closer to broadening
the standard of beauty

00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:53.181
